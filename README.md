| 10.  |VALIDATE-DATETIME-NONOVERLAP|1. Validate event date/time during scheduling and rescheduling that the start and end date/time of the event is not overlapped with another event in the same event category. <br> 2. Front-end: limit/validate eventStartTime before calling back-end to create/update. Note that the back-end may still response with overlapped error, must reload events and ask the user to select date/time again.<br>3.

The front-end must check the local storage whether the JWT token exists. If it does, try to access the backend using the stored token.  <br>4.1 If the token is valid, use the token to access the backend until this token has expired<br>4.2 If the access token has expired, get a refreshed token at /refresh endpoint and store it in the local-storage<br>4.3 If refreshing of token failed or the token is invalid, the user must authenticate again to use the members' only features"  |
